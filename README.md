## Installation

`go get github.com/go-kata/kinit`

## Versioning convention

**This is a beta version.** API is not stabilized for now.

*Till the first major release* minor version (`v0.x.0`) must be treated as a major version and patch version (`v0.0.x`) must be treated as a minor version.

For example, changing of version from `v0.1.0` to `v0.1.1` indicates compatible changes, but when version changes `v0.1.1` to `v0.2.0` this means that the last version breaks the API.
